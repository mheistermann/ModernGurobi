# ModernGurobi
## *Inofficial* C++ Interface Alternative for Gurobi

The C++ interface distributed with Gurobi (at least 6.5) is a binary static
library, with compilers only up to g++5.2, this causes trouble when linking.

This is an alternate *INOFFICIAL* C++ interface that is much less complete,
however available under a free license, so you can compile it with any
compiler you like and extend it to your liking.

It is currently very incomplete, just enough for my personal needs. I would
appreciate it if you would contribute your own extensions as pull requests.
